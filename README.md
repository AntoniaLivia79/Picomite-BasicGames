# The Picomite-BASIC Book of Computer Games

A collection of classic BASIC games from 80's game compendium books and magazines, ported to Picomite Basic.

These are classic BASIC games ported to Picomite BASIC (running from an RP2350). They have not been tested on the PicoCalc, so may require tweaks to run on this device.

The original BASIC source code for some of these games was taken from https://github.com/chaosotter/basic-games.git.
